## Source Code and Configuration Files

### Describe in detail how the completed source code works

#### A function that confirms that a file containing data is valid

```
def confirm_valid_file(file: Path) -> bool:
    """Confirm that the provided file is a valid path."""
    # determine if the file is not None and if it is a file
    if file is not None:
        # the file is valid
        if file.is_file():
            return True
    # the file was either none or not valid
    return False
```

Essentially what this is saying is that the function called "confirm_valid_file" is going to determine if the file has numbers in it. It is also going to confirm that the file exists. It will also say if the file is a valid path, meaning a valid directory. It will do this using an if statement. By saying if the file is not none it is saying that if the file has things in it it will return the word "True", but if the file either doesnt exist or has nothing in it it will return "False". 

#### A function that squares an integer using a `for` loop

```
def compute_square_for(value: int) -> int:
    """Compute the square of a number through iteration with a for loop."""
    # initialize the answer to zero
    answer = 0
    # repeatedly add to the answer the absolute value of the variable called value
    for _ in range(abs(value)):
        answer = answer + abs(value)
    # return the computed integer square
    return answer
```
This is a function called compute_for_square that uses a for loop to iterate through the the list of integers within the numbers.txt file and square them by first taking the
