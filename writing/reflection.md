## Source Code and Configuration Files

### Describe in detail how the completed source code works

#### A function that confirms that a file containing data is valid

```
def confirm_valid_file(file: Path) -> bool:
    """Confirm that the provided file is a valid path."""
    # determine if the file is not None and if it is a file
    if file is not None:
        # the file is valid
        if file.is_file():
            return True
    # the file was either none or not valid
    return False
```

Essentially what this is saying is that the function called "confirm_valid_file" is going to determine if the file has numbers in it, that the file exists, and it will also say if the file is a valid path, meaning a valid directory. It will do this using an if statement. By saying "if the file is not none" it is saying that if the file has things in it it will return the word "True", but if the file either doesnt exist or has nothing in it it will return "False".

#### A function that squares an integer using a `for` loop

```
def compute_square_for(value: int) -> int:
    """Compute the square of a number through iteration with a for loop."""
    # initialize the answer to zero
    answer = 0
    # repeatedly add to the answer the absolute value of the variable called value
    for _ in range(abs(value)):
        answer = answer + abs(value)
    # return the computed integer square
    return answer
```

This is a function called compute_for_square that uses a for loop to iterate through the list of integers within the numbers.txt file. First it will take the string of numbers and turn them into individual integers. Then it will square them by first taking the absolute value of that number, it does so by using the "for _ in range(abs(value))", and then using the answer variable in "answer = 0" it will add the absolute value of the integer to the answer variable giving the output of a squared integer.

#### A function that uses a `while` loop to square an integer value

```
def compute_square_while(value: int) -> int:
    """Compute the square of a number through iteration with a while loop."""
    # initialize the number of iterations and the answer
    num_iterations = 0
    answer = 0
    # repeatedly increase the answer until getting to the value
    while num_iterations < abs(value):
        answer = answer + abs(value)
        num_iterations = num_iterations + 1
    # return the computed integer square
    return answer
```

This is saying that first the string will be converted into integers so that each number becomes a singular integer. Then is will iterate through the file called numbers.txt. Notice though, that this has a new variable called num_iterations = 0 this is set there because the while loop functions on the condition that if there are still more numbers to go through then continue through the file. So every time it iterates through the loop it will at 1 to the num_iterations variable. That is done through this line of code "num_iterations = num_iterations + 1". Then there is also the answer variable which will in the beginning also be set to zero. This is similar to the for loop in a sense that when the loop collects the integer it will add the absolute value of the integer to answer which equals 0. Then it will return answer which is the squared value of the integer.

#### An enumeration class that defines the options for squaring an integer

```
from enum import Enum
```

This is basically telling the computer to go into a class called enum and import Enum from that class.

#### An example of a higher-order function that accepts a function as input

```
def compute_square_iterative(
    contents: str, square_function: Callable[[int], int]
) -> List[int]:
    """Compute the square of all of the integer values inside of the contents."""
    squared_values = []
    for x in contents.split("\n"):
        if x != '':
            squared_values.append(square_function(int(x)))
    return squared_values
```

This function is a bit more complicated. It is called compute_square_iterative and this function is going to call on antoher function in order to square the values and print them as a list. In the first line of code, it is defining the function and telling it to take the string of integers in the numbers.txt file and turn them into a list of integers. The list will then be called squared_values. From there the function will iterate into a for loop that says for the integer, in this case x, in contents we will split them and create a single integer. Then if x has a value (does not equal nothing) we will append (or bring back) the squared value from the square_function callable list and print that squared value.
